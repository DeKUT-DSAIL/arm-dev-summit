# Baseline models

A baseline model is a simple model that provides reasonable results and doesn't require much expertise and time to build. In this repo, we will use `Random Forest classifier`, `Multilayer Perceptron`, `Linear Support Vector Classifier` and `Support Vector Classifier`. The baseline models exhibited good performance on train-validation data.
